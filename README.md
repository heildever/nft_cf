# Non-Fungible Token Crowd Sale
This project started as discovery and never completed. The repo is, unfortunately, deprecated.
## Getting Started
This repo is meant to be a non-fungible token crowdsale event, almost like an ICO but with non-fungible tokens (possibly security tokens) instead of utility tokens. 
### Prerequisites 
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
- [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli)
- [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)
### Installing
1. Start by cloning the repo `git clone https://github.com:heildever/nft_cf.git` 
2. Then cd into project directory and install Node packages with `npm install nft_cf`
followed by `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install python dependencies.
## Deployment
Familiarity with Ethereum frameworks is e.g Truffle, Embark will save time to understand how the project works/is structured. Make sure your Ganache is up and running with at least 2 accounts. 
### Comments
`/src` folder contains *interactor.py*, a python script using **web3.py**, to interact with the to accounts to send 1 Wei from 1st account to 0th account created by Ganache. Account addresses are randomly generated by Ganache at each run, hardcoding, like I did in this script, is not a good exercise.
This was to test the receivability of the smart contract accounts, has nothing to do minting & crowd sale. 
Test scripts can stored under `/test`.
